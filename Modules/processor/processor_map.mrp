Interim Summary
---------------

    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      2,521 out of  27,288    9%
    Number used as logic:                    2,521 out of  27,288    9%
      Number using O6 output only:           1,408
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                1,113
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,408    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                       56 out of  13,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,662
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,226 out of   2,662   46%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 141 out of   2,662    5%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,295 out of   2,662   48%
    Number of unique control sets:              48
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             131 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network output_bus<7> has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 7 more times for the following
   (max. 5 shown):
   output_bus<6>,
   output_bus<5>,
   output_bus<4>,
   output_bus<3>,
   output_bus<2>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)

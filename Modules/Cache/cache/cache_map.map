      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                   45
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,408    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   110 out of   6,822    1%
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                        0 out of  13,644    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          332
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           214 out of     332   64%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  13 out of     332    3%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         105 out of     332   31%
    Number of unique control sets:               9
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              42 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

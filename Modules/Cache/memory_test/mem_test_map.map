    Number used as logic:                       71 out of  27,288    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              54
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                   17
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,408    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    23 out of   6,822    1%
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                        0 out of  13,644    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           71
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            18 out of      71   25%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      71    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          53 out of      71   74%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               9 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

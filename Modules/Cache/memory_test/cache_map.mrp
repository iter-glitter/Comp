Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    46 out of  54,576    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  46
    Number used as Latches:                      0
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         44 out of  27,288    1%
    Number used as logic:                       44 out of  27,288    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              42
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                    2
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,408    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                        0 out of  13,644    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           50
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             4 out of      50    8%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   6 out of      50   12%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          40 out of      50   80%
    Number of unique control sets:               3
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               2 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
